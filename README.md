# Deep_Q-Learning

GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py given by SNHU as part of coursework

The goal here was to be able to create an AI that is capable of finding treasure in a simple maze. I used reinforcement learning and neural networks to accomplish this, specifically deep Q-learning where we have a neural network take the place of the Q-table. I also used an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy in order to balance exploration and exploitation in the AI. For this project I was essentially given everything but the actual Q-learning algorithm. The Q-learning algorithm I had to develop myself and that required quite a bit of research as well as trial and error.
